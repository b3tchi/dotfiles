name: story-read
description: Use when the user wants to see, list, find, search, summarize, or look up user stories from the product backlog — reads AKM story zettels (`docs/notes/us###.md`) and returns a filtered table, a single story detail, or a full markdown render depending on the query. Invoke this whenever someone asks "what stories do we have", "show me story X", "list draft stories", "what's in the backlog", "find stories about Y", or otherwise wants to view product backlog content even if they don't say the word "story".

# Story Read

## Overview

Read user-story zettels under `docs/notes/us###.md` and present them in the format that best fits the user's question. Three output modes — pick one based on the query, don't combine.

**Announce at start:** "Using story-read skill to surface the backlog."

## AKM Workspace Resolution

Readers always anchor on the main worktree's view of the AKM, never the
feature worktree's local copy (which may be stale or branch-divergent).
Resolve first:

```bash
AKM_ROOT="$(akm-root)"
```

All lookups anchor on `$AKM_ROOT/docs/notes/...`. If `akm-root` errors,
surface its stderr and fall back to cwd with the warning *"reading from
cwd worktree — may be stale; check out the default branch for canonical
view"*.

## Storage

**Backend:** AKM (Agentic Knowledge Model). Stories live as individual markdown zettels in `$AKM_ROOT/docs/notes/us###.md`. The schema is documented in `docs/notes/akm.md`; this skill only needs the slice below.

If `$AKM_ROOT/docs/notes/` does not contain any `us*.md` files: tell the user "No stories found. Use story-write to add one." Don't fabricate a backlog.

### Zettel slice this skill needs

```markdown
---
aliases:
  - <human-readable title / want clause>          # first alias = title
status: <draft|ready|in_progress|done|dropped>
created: YYYY-MM-DD
---
# Story [[<tag>]] [[<tag>]] [[product]]

## role
[[pn###|<persona-alias>]]

## want
<one-liner>

## because
<one-liner>

## acceptance_criteria
- <bullet>
- <bullet>
```

**Key extraction rules:**

- `id` — the filename slug (`us001` for `us001.md`).
- `title` — first entry under `aliases:` in frontmatter.
- `status`, `created` — frontmatter scalars.
- `role` — text under `## role`; usually a wikilink `[[pn###|alias]]`. **Render the alias label**, not the raw wikilink (the alias is the human-friendly name).
- `want`, `because` — body text under those H2s, one paragraph each.
- `acceptance_criteria` — bullets under `## acceptance_criteria`.
- `tags` — every wikilink in the H1 **except `[[product]]`** (the product link is structural, not a tag). Render as the link target slug (e.g. `[[requestor-flow]]` → `requestor-flow`).

If a story is missing any of these sections, render what's there and omit silently — don't crash on incomplete drafts.

## Mode Selection

```dot
digraph mode_select {
    "User query" [shape=oval];
    "Specific id mentioned?" [shape=diamond];
    "Filter implied?" [shape=diamond];
    "Detail mode" [shape=box];
    "Table mode" [shape=box];
    "Render mode" [shape=box];

    "User query" -> "Specific id mentioned?";
    "Specific id mentioned?" -> "Detail mode" [label="yes (e.g. us001 or unique title match)"];
    "Specific id mentioned?" -> "Filter implied?" [label="no"];
    "Filter implied?" -> "Table mode" [label="yes (status / role / keyword filter)"];
    "Filter implied?" -> "Render mode" [label="no (broad 'show me everything')"];
}
```

### Detail mode triggers
- Query contains a story id like `us001` (case-insensitive; `US001` and `us001` are the same — AKM `case_matching = "Smart"` makes wikilinks equivalent).
- Query references a single specific story unambiguously by title.
- Phrases like "show me story X", "tell me about story X", "what does story X say".

### Table mode triggers
- Status filters: `draft`, `ready`, `in_progress`, `done`, `dropped`, `open`, `closed`, `pending`.
- Role mentions: "stories for requestors", "all approver stories".
- Keyword search: "find stories about approval", "anything related to catalog".
- "List …", "what … are pending", "how many … are done".

### Render mode triggers
- "Show me the backlog".
- "What user stories do we have".
- "Print all stories".
- No filter and no specific id.

If the query is ambiguous between table and render, prefer **table** — it's more scannable. Render is for full audits.

## Reading the zettels

Two-step pattern: list files cheaply, parse only what you need.

1. **List ids.** `ls "$AKM_ROOT/docs/notes/"us*.md` (or in-process equivalent). The filename slug is the id.
2. **Read per mode:**
   - **Detail mode** — read only the one matching file.
   - **Table mode** — read all `us*.md` to extract frontmatter + role + title; you can skip body sections after `## want` is found if your tooling supports it, but a full read per file is fine (these are small).
   - **Render mode** — read every `us*.md` fully (acceptance criteria are needed).

If you have shell access, you can pipe `head -20` on each file to grab frontmatter + role cheaply for the table mode. Do not assume the file order matches id order; sort by filename after reading.

## Mode 1: Detail

Show one story in full. Use this exact template:

```markdown
## [id] — [title]

**As a** [persona-alias], **I want** [want], **because** [because].

**Tags:** [tag1, tag2, ...]    **Status:** [status]    **Created:** [created]

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [criterion 1]
- [criterion 2]
- ...
```

If the lookup is by title and matches multiple stories, fall back to table mode showing the matches.

If the id does not exist: "Story `us001` not found. Closest matches: ..." and list 1-3 candidates by title similarity. Don't guess — let the user pick.

If the H1 has no tag wikilinks (only `[[product]]`), omit the **Tags:** label rather than rendering an empty list.

## Mode 2: Table

Render a markdown table. Columns:

| id | status | role | title |

Sort by id ascending unless the user asked otherwise. Apply the filter implied by the query before rendering.

**Example:**

```markdown
| id    | status | role      | title                                       |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| us001 | done   | requestor | order samples for upcoming client work      |
| us013 | draft  | requestor | resubmit a Rejected or Blocked request      |
```

After the table, add a one-line summary: `3 stories matched (2 draft, 1 done).`

If zero matched: state the filter explicitly so the user can see what was searched. Example: "No stories with status=ready and role contains 'approver'."

## Mode 3: Render

Full markdown dump of the entire backlog, grouped by status. Group order: `draft` → `ready` → `in_progress` → `done` → `dropped`. Within each group, sort by id ascending.

```markdown
# Product Backlog

## Draft

### us013 — resubmit a Rejected or Blocked request after revising it
**As a** requestor, **I want** to resubmit a rejected or blocked request after revising it, **because** I don't want to recreate the whole request from scratch.

- request can be reopened from the rejected/blocked view
- previous line items pre-fill the new submission
- audit trail links the resubmission to the original

### us014 — ...
...

## Ready

### us006 — ...
...

## Done

### us001 — order samples for upcoming client work
...
```

End with a one-line summary: `Total: N stories (X draft, Y ready, Z in_progress, W done, V dropped).` Omit zero-count buckets from the summary.

## Filter Parsing

Translate natural-language filters into structured matches:

| User says | Match against |
|-----------|---------------|
| "draft", "pending", "open" | `status: draft` |
| "ready" | `status: ready` |
| "in progress", "in_progress", "active", "working" | `status: in_progress` |
| "done", "closed", "finished" | `status: done` |
| "dropped", "abandoned" | `status: dropped` |
| "for requestors", "approver stories" | persona alias contains the keyword (case-insensitive substring) |
| "about approval", "related to catalog" | any text field (title, want, because, acceptance_criteria) OR any H1 tag contains the keyword (case-insensitive) |

Multiple filters compose with AND. Example: "draft stories about catalog" → `status == draft AND any-text-field-or-tag contains 'catalog'`.

For role filtering, remember the role field is `[[pn###|alias]]` — match against the alias label, not the persona id. If you need the alias and only have the id, read `$AKM_ROOT/docs/notes/pn###.md` and pick the first `aliases:` entry. Cache that lookup if you read more than one story.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- It does not modify stories. To edit, use `story-write` (re-emit) or edit the markdown directly.
- It does not create bd tasks or trigger downstream workflows.
- It does not estimate, prioritize, or invent metadata not in the zettel.
- It does not paginate. If the backlog grows huge, prefer table mode with a filter.
- It does not validate wikilinks (`[[product]]`, `[[pn###]]`, etc.). The moxide LSP is the source of truth for link health; this skill just renders what's there.

## When to Defer to Other Skills

- User wants to add a story → `story-write`.
- User wants design discussion based on a story → `idea-brainstorming`.
- User wants to turn a story into an implementation plan → `spec-writing`.
- User wants to find which code implements a story → `story-map`.
- User wants traceability between system area and stories → `story-find`.
